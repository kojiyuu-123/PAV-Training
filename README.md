# Data Structure

## Introduction

Data Structure is a way of collecting and organising data in such a way that we can perform operations on these data in an effective way. Data Structures is about rendering data elements in terms of some relationship, for better organization and storage.

For example, we have some data which has, player's **name** "Virat" and **age** 26. Here "Virat" is of **String** data type and 26 is of **Integer** data type. We can organize this data as a record like **Player** record, which will have both player's name and age in it. Now we can collect and store player's records in a file or database as a data structure. For example: "Dhoni" 30, "Gambhir" 31, "Sehwag" 33

As you learned in OOP, a class also does the same thing, it collects different type of data under one single entity. The only difference being, data structures provides for techniques to access and manipulate data efficiently.

In simple language, Data Structures are structures programmed to store ordered data, so that various operations can be performed on it easily. It represents the knowledge of data to be organized in memory. It should be designed and implemented in such a way that it reduces the complexity and increases the efficiency.

So as above, anything that can store data can be called as a data structure, hence Integer, Float, Boolean, Char, ... all are data structures. They are known as **Primitive Data Structures** or **Primitive Types** and are mentioned in Basic Programming Chapter. In this chapter, we will learn other data structures, they are **Non Primitive Types**.

For developer, we will use Array and Linked List very common, Stack and Queue is less than. Hash Table is useful when searching. They are described in detail in [Basic Data Structure](#basic-data-structure). After understanding them, you can read  others in [Advanced Data Structure](#Advanced-Data-Structure) to challenge and improve yourself.

## Basic Data Structure

1. [Array](./array.md)
2. [Linked List](./linked-list.md)
3. [Set](./set.md)
4. [Stack](./stack.md)
5. [Queue](./queue.md)

## Advanced Data Structure

1. [Tree](./tree.md)
2. [Trie (Keyword Tree)]()
3. [Segment Tree]()
4. [Binary Indexed]()
5. [Suffix Tree]()
6. [Suffix Array]()
