# SQL-CRUD

## Introduction

In the database programming, there are four basic and essential operations: create, read, update, and delete. 
These operations can be defined as the first step in database programming and are called CRUD operations. 
CRUD is an acronym of the CREATE, READ, UPDATE and DELETE words. 
The CRUD term was once mentioned by James Martin in his book ‘Managing the Database Environment’ and since then this term has become popular. 
In this article, we will explore the CRUD operation in terms of SQL Server because the operation syntax can differ from other relational and NoSQL databases. 
First of all, we will define the database table; a table is a database object which stores data. The table is based on the rows and columns. If you want to create a table, you need at least one column and this column must be of a data type.
The main idea of relational databases is that data is stored in tables. 
In addition, this table data can be read, inserted, deleted or edited by the CRUD operations. So CRUD operation is basically used to manipulate table data.

- CREATE – insert row/rows to table.
- READ – read (select) row/rows from a table.
- UPDATE – edit row/rows in the table.
- DELETE – delete row/rows in the table.
