# Overview
localStorage is a new JavaScript API in HTML5 that allows us to save data in key/value pairs in a user's browser.

localStorage has a little bit similar with Cookie, except:
- Cookies expire and get cleared a lot, localStorage is forever (until explicitly cleared).
- localStorage isn't sent along in HTTP Requests, you have to ask for it.
- You can store way `more data` (at least 5MB) in localStorage than you can in cookies.

Forgot the cookie? check again [Cookie - Session](../cookie-session/readme.md)

Web Storage have also supply us 2 kind of storage: localStorage (store forever until you or user delete it) and sessionStorage (on session only, when close tab, its data lost)
